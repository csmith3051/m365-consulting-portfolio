## About Me

Hi there. I’m Corinne, a Microsoft 365 Consultant with over a decade of experience guiding digital transformation across education, energy, and public health. My background in higher education shapes a consulting style that’s collaborative, learner-centered, and grounded in research.

I’m currently completing my doctorate at UCLA, where I study how diverse teams drive innovation in technology. That lens informs everything I build—from dashboards to training kits—with empathy, clarity, and strategic foresight.

I specialize in:
- Microsoft 365 strategy, governance, and enablement  
- Power BI dashboards and data storytelling  
- Copilot prompt design and AI adoption  
- Change management and stakeholder communications  
- Inclusive, research-informed consulting practices

## Custom GPT Agent for Microsoft 365 Enablement

To accelerate Microsoft 365 adoption and empower users, I’ve built a custom GPT agent designed for consultants, program managers, and IT teams. It supports:

- 🧩 Copilot prompt generation tailored to roles and workflows  
- 📄 Drafting training materials, documentation, and communications  
- 📊 Exploring Power BI dashboard ideas and use cases  
- 🛡️ Planning governance, change management, and rollout strategies

### How to Use It

1. Open the link above in ChatGPT  
2. Ask questions like:  
   - “Give me 5 Copilot prompts for a customer service manager”  
   - “Draft a training email for Power BI dashboard rollout”  
   - “What governance policies should I include for SharePoint?”  
3. Refine your query or ask follow-ups. The agent is designed to guide you through strategy and execution.

This tool reflects my consulting approach: practical, user-centered, and built to scale across industries.
