## 🧠 Custom GPT Agent: Microsoft 365 Enablement Advisor

To accelerate Microsoft 365 adoption and empower users, I’ve built a custom GPT agent designed for consultants, program managers, and IT teams. It supports:

- 🧩 Copilot prompt generation tailored to roles and workflows  
- 📄 Drafting training materials, documentation, and communications  
- 📊 Exploring Power BI dashboard ideas and use cases  
- 🛡️ Planning governance, change management, and rollout strategies

### How to Use It

1. Open the link above in ChatGPT  
2. Ask questions like:  
   - “Give me 5 Copilot prompts for a customer service manager”  
   - “Draft a training email for Power BI dashboard rollout”  
   - “What governance policies should I include for SharePoint?”  
3. Refine your query or ask follow-ups—the agent is designed to guide you through strategy and execution.

This tool reflects my consulting approach: practical, user-centered, and built to scale across industries.
